jekyll = ["He began to go wrong, wrong in the mind,",

"The large, handsome face of Dr Jekyll grew pale to the lips and there came a blackness about his eyes",

"You must suffer me to go my own dark way.",

"Like some disconsolate prisoner",

"Weeping like a woman or a lost soul",

"Pale and shaken and half fainting, and groping before him with his hands, like a man restored for death-there stood Henry Jekll"]
